Polymorphism: Animal cat = new Cat() -> call exactly method hello() of Cat
Encapsulation: cover private attribute, just give user function to call them
Inheritance: child has method of parent

Abstraction : make sure have method, can't create a object from abstract class
ex: abstract class animal -> can't "Animal dog = new Animal();"

Interface : greater than Encapsulation(just in class), just call method of interface
